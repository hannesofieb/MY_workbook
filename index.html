            <figcaption class="caption">A second verison of the 'oeuvre' idea (same idea but as a website) Could present an artist's oeuvre by eggs and when you click them the songs play? Or you could make it even more interactive, and have an egg carton with eggs, and when you click on the egg to crack it you get a song. Perhaps adding a mixing bowl and you can mix songs together (like a DJ).<a href="index.html">x</a></figcaption>
